Scripts for syncing and grabbing data from bigdipper.

Currently, sync_bigdipper.sh is run as a cronjob from chiniak once a day to run archive_ak_data.bash on bigdipper. 
All the real work is done by a collection of bash scripts written by Alex Morris for dealing with the SuperDARN data files on the ARSC bigdipper data archive that are also included in this folder.
For fun, I am also including a python script for automating copying of data from bigdipper back to chiniak.
