Scripts to automate radar status checks and status alert emails.
It is currently a mess..

chiniak_scripts has scripts which run on local computers. daily_radar_healthcheck.py is called every two hours in a cronjob.
radar_scripts has scripts which are placed in the path of the radar linux computers
